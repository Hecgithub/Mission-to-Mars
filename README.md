# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
For this job, we used web scrapping and various tools to extract data about the Mission to Mars. We used MongoDB to store our data and then render the data in a web application created in Flask. To conduct the web scrapping, we used splinter to automate a web browser and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data. Once all the data was collected, we could display it in a central location (a webpage). 

## Results 
Using Bootstrap 3, we adjusted the page to center the text, bolded the title and made the scarping button smaller. The scraping button allows new information to be scrapped from various websites.

## Summary
